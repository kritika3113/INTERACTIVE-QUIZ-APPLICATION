Interactive Quiz Application is a fully responsive, feature-rich web quiz built with vanilla **JavaScript**, **HTML5**, and **CSS3**—no external frameworks required. The project was crafted in Visual Studio Code and focuses on clean architecture, smooth animations, and an engaging user experience across devices.

## Highlights

- **Structured Question Flow**
  - Ten carefully curated multiple-choice questions covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTTP, Git, and tooling fundamentals.
  - Options are presented using accessible buttons with keyboard support and focus states.
  - Question counter and animated progress bar clearly communicate how far the user has progressed.

- **Immediate Feedback Loop**
  - Selecting an answer instantly highlights the correct response and shows a contextual explanation.
  - Incorrect attempts reveal the right option so learners can review and retry with better understanding.

- **Live Scoring & Summary**
  - The score updates after each question, mirrored both in the header and the final summary view.
  - Completing the quiz surfaces a results card with total score and tailored encouragement based on performance.

- **Responsive, Polished UI**
  - Layout adapts gracefully from large screens down to mobile devices using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and fluid spacing.
  - The interface ships with a custom dark theme, tactile hover states, and subtle shadows that guide attention without distractions.

- **Replay-Friendly Controls**
  - `Next` button activates only after an answer is chosen, eliminating accidental skips.
  - A persistent `Restart Quiz` button lets users reset the experience at any time, while the summary view also offers a restart option.

- **Extensions used**

  - ESLint & Prettier for linting and formatting.
  - Chrome DevTools for responsive debugging.
